#Learning Automation - Selenium

I was interested in how automation, hence I went to test how this works after learning Selenium on Udemy by RahulAcademy.  
After I've learnt on how to use Selenium to automate stuff, I went on to try on a website called SBST 50th Anniversary. It was a joy to be able to test on a website after learning the basic automation skills.

#Things I've learnt 
Automation, searching elements via xpath/class/css.selector/id/others, and also usage of various classes.

#Others
I tested on my first portfolio website as well, [https://fastumkj.github.io/] to submit a dummy form.
